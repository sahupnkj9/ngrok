# ðŸ“± Mobile Error Fix - PlatformConstants Issue

## ðŸš¨ Issue Fixed
The error `PlatformConstants could not be found` has been resolved by:

### **Changes Made:**
1. **Removed conflicting crypto package** - This was causing module conflicts
2. **Disabled New Architecture** - Set `newArchEnabled: false` for better compatibility
3. **Added proper expo-constants plugin** configuration
4. **Created Metro config** for better module resolution
5. **Updated Babel config** with module resolver
6. **Fixed dependencies** with `expo install --fix`

### **Steps to Apply the Fix:**

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npx expo install --fix
   ```

2. **Clear cache and restart:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

3. **Test on mobile:**
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go
   - App should load without PlatformConstants error

### **If Error Persists:**

1. **Clear Expo cache completely:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   npx expo start --clear --reset-cache
   ```

2. **Update Expo Go app** on your phone to latest version

3. **Try development build** if issues continue:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   # or
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

### **What Was Wrong:**
- The `crypto` package was conflicting with React Native's built-in crypto
- New Architecture was enabled but not all dependencies support it yet
- Missing proper module resolution configuration
- expo-constants plugin wasn't properly configured

### **Expected Result:**
âœ… App loads successfully on mobile device  
âœ… No more PlatformConstants errors  
âœ… All navigation and features work properly  

The app should now work perfectly on your mobile device!
